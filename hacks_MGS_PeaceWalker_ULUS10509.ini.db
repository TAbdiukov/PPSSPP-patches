//
_C0 All missions are available for multiplayer with 8 players max
//
// [YES] The romhack successfully makes changes only when the game is at the right state (without this factor, the romhack will crash the game often)
// [YES] The romhack successfully makes singleplayer missions multiplayer
// [YES] The romhack successfully modifies max players value
// BUT:
// [NO] If more players join than the game originally allows, things break (however, when the right number of people join, nothing breaks, so at least the romhack doesn't break multiplayer)
// However, previously singleplayer missions were reported to allow 2 players!
// Which confirms the functionality of the base romhack! It means something else (asset/some 'knowledge') is missing for extra players.

// CURRENT BELIEF: The romhack works, but more of MGS:PW game needs to be modded.
//
//
// [*] Note: in the game code, 'max players' is set to 8 by default, so it seems to be a safe value
// high values (e.g., 0x7F) cause the game to softlock.
//
// [*] Note: Even higher values than 8, such as 9 (or higher, if more of the game is modified) are possible,
// but the game defaults to 8 players in its code, and let's get 8 players working first!
// (in the spirit of Agile - small incremental changes)
//
// Usage:
// 1. Enable romhack at any time
// 2. Ensure game itself is ready: data is installed, the savefile progression grants multiplayer
// 3. Load game
// 4. L -> Mission Selector -> X
// 5. Select any mission (singleplayer or multiplayer)
// 6. Skip dialogue (Start) -> Host
// 7. Select any channel
// 8. Start that multiplayer mission session, observe max player value of 8
// Patch begin:
// 	1. First, we check if the game is in "Mission Selector" mode
